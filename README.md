OPTIMIZATION_IN_SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT

📊 Project Name: Optimisation in Supply Chain Management

🌐 ABOUT PROJECT:

🚀 OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this project is to minimize inventory volatility for pallets by implementing an automated system to optimize stock levels, reducing both understocking and overstocking issues.

Business Problem: Number of pallets to be stored in inventory for shipping to different customers is very volatile leading to understocking or overstocking. Understocking is leading to not hanaring client requirements and overstocking is leading to inventory cost.

Business Success Criteria: Reduce the volatility by atleast 30%.

Economic Success Criteria: Achieve a cost saving of atleast 1 million dollars.

Business Constraint: Minimize human intervention in the inventory management process to enhance efficiency and reduce the risk of errors in handling pallet stock levels.
